    "# Getting Started with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs make it easy to collect data for text mining and machine learning projects. In this workshop, we'll learn how to collect data from APIs, query APIs to filter the data we fetch, and process the data that APIs return to extract information of interest. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every API is an interface to a database. When we interact with the API, we fetch data from the database. This series of relationships could be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: center'><img src='./assets/api-schematic.png'><a href='https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-restful-api-with-rails-4b98dc76bf9c'>Image by Hector Polanco</a></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As this illustration indicates, a user tells an API what kind of data they would like, then the API fetches that data from a database and sends it to the user. Let's see this in action in our first example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving Crossword Puzzles with the DataMuse API\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, let's consider the DataMuse API. This API allows us to interact with a database that contains information about words. Using the DataMuse API, we can find words with certain constraints. Suppose for example we are completing the puzzle below and wish to find words that would fit into <i>2 Down</i>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style='text-align: center'>\n",
    "    <img style='width:140px;margin: 20px auto;' src='./assets/crossword-puzzle.png'>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for <i>2 Down</i>, we need a four-letter word that begins with S and ends with D. How can we use the DataMuse API to get a list of words that meet our criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the structure for URL queries varies somewhat depending on the API, we recommend starting out by reading the documentation for the API you're using. To see what URL patterns you can use to query the DataMuse database, take a look at: [the DataMuse API documentation](https://www.datamuse.com/api/):\n",

    "This output is an example of JSON, a popular data format often used by APIs. To make that JSON data easier to analyze, let's paste it into a \"JSON prettifier\", such as <a href='https://www.jsonformatter.io/' target='_blank'>https://www.jsonformatter.io/</a>. If you do so, you should see something similar to the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "The data on the right is identical to the data on the left, except the data on the right is formatted (or \"prettified\") to be a little easier to read. Looking at that right-hand column, we see a few types of data that we will need to understand in order to be able to work more with this API.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Square Braces = List\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can see that the JSON data begins (and eventually ends) with <b>square braces</b>: [ ]. In JSON, square braces denote a <b>list</b>. In the case of the DataMuse API, each item in the list contains information about a word that meets the constraints specified in the URL we requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Squiggly Braces = Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can see that each of the words in our list is wrapped with <b>squiggly braces</b>: { }. In JSON, squiggly brace denote a <b>dictionary</b> (which are also sometimes referred to as an \"object\"). Dictionaries are in turn comprised of two kinds of things: <b>keys</b> (located to the left of a colon) and <b>values</b> (to the right of a colon):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/key-value.png' style='height:80px'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary above contains two key:value pairs. The first has the key \"word\" and the value \"shed\". The second has the key \"score\" and the value 3010. We say that each of these values is \"assigned\" to the key it belongs to. So the value assigned to \"word\" is \"shed\", and the value assigned to \"score\" is 3010.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quotation Marks = String\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the keys and the value \"shed\" above, we see that each is wrapped with <b>quotation marks</b>: \" \". In JSON, quotation marks denote a <b>string</b> (a fancy word for \"text data\"). When viewing our JSON data using https://www.jsonformatter.io/, we can see that strings that are values inside a dictionary are colored red, but other text editors may not color code strings at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Whole Numbers = Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, whole numbers such as the number 3010 (colored teal above) are called <b>integers</b>. Integers should not be confused with numbers that contain decimals, which are instead called <b>floats</b>.\n",
